# Task 4 - Shared task on Multimodal Hate Speech Detection #

Hate speech detection is one of the most important aspects of event identification during political events like invasions. In the case of hate speech detection, the event is the occurrence of hate speech, the entity is the target of the hate speech, and the relationship is the connection between the two. Since multimodal content is widely prevalent across the internet, the detection of hate speech in text-embedded images is very important. Given a text-embedded image, this task aims to automatically identify the hate speech and its targets. This task will have two subtasks.

## Sub-task A ##
<b> Hate Speech Detection:</b> The goal of this task is to identify whether the given text-embedded image contains hate speech or not. The text-embedded images, which are the dataset for this subtask, will have annotations for the prevalence of hate speech.

The dataset for this sub-task has two labels viz. "Hate Speech" and "No Hate Speech".

## Sub-task B ##
<b> Target Detection:</b> The goal of this subtask is to identify the targets of hate speech in a given hateful text-embedded image. The text-embedded images are annotated for "community", "individual" and "organization" targets.
